description: Analyze a specific domain using registration, DNS, website, backlink, cross-TLD, and market and legal-risk evidence. Use when a user asks what is known about a domain, wants due diligence before acquiring one, or requests a technical domain analysis. Do not use for generating domain names or simple availability checks.

# Domain Analysis

**What this does:** builds a complete, evidence-based picture of one domain, its registration, DNS setup, cross-TLD footprint, backlink profile, current usage, and market and legal context.

**Data interfaces it needs.** DomainKits MCP supplies part of the technical evidence through the tools below; host-provided web search and WebFetch supply public context and page inspection. Equivalent providers are acceptable. Never assume an MCP payload contains a record type or field that it does not actually return. Mark a missing field or capability `Unavailable` and continue.

- WHOIS / registration lookup, DomainKits: `whois`
- DNS records (at least A, AAAA, MX, NS, TXT, CNAME; CAA when relevant), DomainKits: `dns`
- URL threat check (malicious, phishing, or malware-hosting flags): DomainKits does not provide one. If the user has connected a threat-check tool, ask once whether to use it; if none is connected or the user declines, mark it Unavailable
- Backlink profile (rank, referring domains, spam score, and link-type distribution when the source provides it), DomainKits: `backlink_summary`
- Cross-TLD registration data, DomainKits: `tld_check`
- Public Suffix List rules and IDN / punycode conversion, for input normalization
- Web search capability (market background, news, disputes)
- Web fetch capability (load the domain and its variants), under the fetch rule below

**Fetch rule.** If the user has connected a threat-check tool, ask once whether to run it before fetching any domain's pages in this task, and never fetch a domain it flags. Without a check, tell the user the domain's safety is unverified and fetch only with their go-ahead. Fetch read-only: no form submissions, no credential input, no file downloads.

## Input normalization

Before analyzing, record three forms of the input without silently changing the user's intent: the original input as given, the full hostname, and the registrable domain. For example, `https://mail.example.co.uk/x` has hostname `mail.example.co.uk` and registrable domain `example.co.uk`; `_dmarc.example.com` has hostname `_dmarc.example.com` and registrable domain `example.com`. Query DNS on the hostname the user asked about, adding the registrable domain's records when they matter for context. Use the registrable domain for WHOIS, backlinks, cross-TLD, market, and legal context. When the forms differ, state which one each section uses. Determine the registrable domain using Public Suffix List rules; do not assume it is always the final two labels (`.co.uk`, `.com.au`, `.github.io` and similar require the PSL to split correctly). Convert IDN / Unicode input to its punycode (`xn--`) form and note both. If the input is ambiguous (could map to more than one registrable domain), ask which one before proceeding.

## Evidence discipline

This is the core rule of the skill. Classify every material finding as Fact, Inference, or Unknown. Group related facts where doing so remains unambiguous.

- **Fact:** returned directly by a tool or read from a page (for example, "WHOIS status is clientTransferProhibited", "MX records are present").
- **Inference:** an interpretation supported by one or more facts but not confirmed. Always phrase with "may indicate", "is consistent with", or "suggests", never as fact.
- **Unknown:** the available data cannot decide the question. Say so explicitly.

Never convert absence of data into a negative finding. "No trademark hits returned" is not "the mark is clear"; "no sale record found" is not "never sold"; "no A record" is not "abandoned". Every time-sensitive conclusion must carry the date it was observed.

For DNS, distinguish an explicitly returned empty record set from a record type the source does not support. In particular, if `dns` does not return a `CAA` field, report CAA as `Not Provided` or query an independent DNS source; never interpret the missing field as proof that no CAA record exists.

## Workflow

Run the queries independently. A single tool failing, timing out, returning nothing, or being unavailable must NOT stop the rest of the report; mark that section Unavailable and continue. If the user asked only about one aspect (for example, just DNS, or just backlinks), run that part and skip the rest: deliver only the section(s) that answer the question, plus their evidence limitations and sources, and do not emit the remaining sections of the full structure. The fixed output structure below applies in full only to a full-domain analysis; a narrow request returns the matching subset in the same format.

1. **Gather core data in parallel:**
   - `whois` on the registrable domain for registrar, key dates, and status codes.
   - `dns` on the hostname for A, AAAA, MX, NS, TXT, CNAME, and CAA when the actual response supports it. Otherwise mark CAA `Not Provided` or use an independent DNS source.
   - Threat check through the user's connected threat-check tool, if the user agreed to use it.
   - `backlink_summary` for rank, referring domains, and spam score, plus link-type distribution only when the source returns it.
   - `tld_check` for cross-TLD registration data.

2. **Cross-TLD investigation (conditional).** Use the rating the tool provides. If the tool gives no rating, report the raw count and the set of TLDs checked; do not label a count "high" on your own. If cross-TLD registration is notable, `whois` the common variants (.com/.net/.org) and record the registrars. Report the pattern as a fact; treat its meaning as inference (for example, "several variants use the same registrar, which may indicate they were registered together, but does not establish it; a popular registrar or registrar migrations can produce the same pattern"). Do not attribute the variants to any person or organization. If you fetch the variants to see whether they resolve to the same site, each variant is a distinct domain: apply the fetch rule to each variant, and never carry the target domain's threat-check result over to a variant. For any variant the threat check flags, record the flag, skip the fetch, and report only its non-fetch evidence (WHOIS, DNS).

3. **Website status.** Apply the fetch rule. If the threat check has flagged the domain as malicious, phishing, or malware-hosting, do not fetch it: record the flag and its threat types, mark Website status as not fetched because of the flag, and continue the rest of the analysis (WHOIS, DNS, backlinks, cross-TLD, public records) without waiting for the user. The user may be investigating the domain precisely because it is suspicious. A flag is a detection signal, not proof; it can be a false positive or stale, and a clean result does not prove safety. If the check is clean, or there is no check and the user agrees to an unverified fetch, fetch the domain to determine current use: active business, parked page, for-sale landing, or no content. Distinguish and record HTTP redirects (and their target), TLS errors, login walls, and anti-bot / captcha pages, rather than treating them as "no content". If the user declines an unverified fetch, mark Website status Unavailable.

4. **Market and legal context.** Search the web for context that technical data cannot show: recent sale history, related news or brand events, and legal disputes (UDRP, trademark conflicts). Cite a source for each external claim, with the observation date. Prefer authoritative sources by type: UDRP from official decision databases (WIPO, Forum); trademarks from official trademark registries; sale prices from verifiable sale databases or marketplace announcements. A search-result snippet is not final evidence; open the original page to confirm. Historical pricing MUST distinguish confirmed public sale records from current listing / asking prices; do not merge them. Report a dispute by case number, date, and outcome, without naming individual parties. For a UDRP decision, add a one-sentence summary of what kind of dispute it was and the panel's finding on each of the three UDRP elements (identical or confusingly similar to the complainant's mark; the respondent's rights or legitimate interests; registration and use in bad faith), as the decision states them. Any trademark or UDRP observation is a search result, not a legal opinion.

5. **Synthesize the report** using the fixed structure below, so output is consistent across runs.

## Output structure

This is the structure for a full-domain analysis. For a narrow request (per the workflow note above), return only the sections that answer it, keeping this format and each included section's evidence limitations and sources.

1. **Executive summary**: the few findings that matter most, each with a confidence level:
   - **High:** directly reported by an authoritative source or tool.
   - **Medium:** supported by multiple consistent signals.
   - **Low:** based on a single indirect or incomplete signal.
2. **Registration**: registrar, creation/expiry dates, status codes.
3. **DNS and email**: A/AAAA, NS, MX, TXT, CNAME, CAA as found; note email configuration presence as a fact, not proof of active use.
4. **Website status**: live content, parked, redirect (with target), TLS/login/anti-bot state.
5. **Threat check**: the result from the user's connected threat-check tool, or Unavailable. If flagged as malicious, phishing, or malware-hosting, this is the leading finding: give the threat types, state that the domain was not fetched, and that registration, acquisition, or use is not advised while the flag stands. Note that the flag is a detection signal, not proof.
6. **Backlinks and SEO**: rank, referring domains, spam risk, and link-type distribution only when the source provides it (otherwise mark it Not Provided).
7. **Cross-TLD footprint**: counts, TLDs checked, registrar pattern (fact vs inference).
8. **Market and legal context**: sales history (public sale vs asking price), news, disputes (for UDRP: case number, outcome, dispute type, and the panel's three-element findings), each with source and date.
9. **Evidence gaps and limitations**: every section marked Unavailable, and what could not be determined.
10. **Sources and observation timestamps**: external sources and the dates each fact was observed.

Do not make buy / don't-buy judgments, with one exception: a domain flagged by the threat check as malicious, phishing, or malware-hosting is reported as not advised for registration, acquisition, or use. Otherwise present evidence and let the user decide.

## Next steps

If the user's goal is not already known, ask one concise follow-up question. Otherwise, tailor next steps directly to the stated goal:

- Wants market pricing: a listing-based comparative market analysis is available, positioning the domain against current for-sale comparables rather than estimating a sale price (see domain-cma-valuation).
- Domain is listed for sale: state which marketplace it is on so the user can verify it directly.
- Wants alternatives: a naming consultation with a taken-target mode is available (see domain-name-advisor).
- Wants to track changes: a monitoring capability can watch the domain.

## Key principles

- Never fetch a domain that the threat check has flagged as malicious, phishing, or malware-hosting, and without a threat check, fetch only with the user's go-ahead. A flag skips the fetch, not the analysis: continue the non-fetch sections. Make the threat flag the leading finding, treat it as a detection signal rather than proof, and default the assessment to not advised for registration, acquisition, or use.
- Classify every material finding as fact, inference, or unknown. Use "may indicate" / "is consistent with" for inference.
- Absence of a record is never proof of absence. Do not read "not found" as "does not exist".
- Every query is independent; one failure marks a section Unavailable and does not abort the report.
- Every time-sensitive claim carries its observation date; every external claim carries its source.
- When a domain is for sale, name the marketplace so the user can verify it. Do not add referral or affiliate links.
